# opm
This repository includes the code of an algorithm, IGV, proposed for the OpM problem, published in International Transactions on Operational Research, 2023. The algorithm is implemented in Java, C++, and Python. Only the last two langauges were used in the paper though. Please adjust the algorithm based on your requirements (as we did differerently in different sections of the paper). In partcular, please adjust the termiantion coniditon. Currerntly, it is such that the algorithm runs 10 seconds on each instance. Also, please change the path to where your data are stored, and generate the report as you require. Currerntly, it only reports the best objective value and the duration (i.e. the running) time for each run on each instance. It currerntly runs 10 times per instance, which you may change. Finally, it currerntly runs on the large dataset described in the paper, although an additional function is also included to use if you want to read the instances of the small dataset.
